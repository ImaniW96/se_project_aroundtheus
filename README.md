# Project 3: Around The U.S.

### Overview

- Intro
- Figma
- Images

**Intro**

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.

**Figma**

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

Good luck and have fun!

Project 3: Around the U.S.

This project showcasts Jacques Cousteau exploring the world. The six cards highlight some of the beautiful
places he has explored.

In this project with the help of media queries, every element was configured to display correctly on popular screen sizes. Display grid as well as flex box created the layout of the cards. And with Figma the design was provided.
